    If you can not access the options for the algorithm, the folder you choose
    probably does not contain the right format or amount of files. Please make
    sure that you provide a folder with fastq.gz files that are labelled as:
    <br>SAMPLENAME_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz and SAMPLENAME_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz<br>
    respectively for forward and reverse sequence files.<br>
    These instructions should be displayed on the left hand side in the Data
    Analysis tab if you select a folder not matching the requirements.
